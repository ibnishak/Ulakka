# ulakka: Blogging for me and my grandma

Ulakka is a static site generator using Tiddlywiki. The major differences with all other static site generators are:

1. No terminal involved. Just upload your tiddlywiki file using inbuilt github saver, sitback and relax.
2. Incremental build. Publish only those pages which are modified since last publish. (Overridable)
